Enemies are approaching. There are 10 waves of them. We need to survive.

There are 3 types of towers you can build:

- **laser** - the fast one,
- **v-beam** - the stronger one; its beam covers all tiles above and below,
  therefore you cannot build anything else on its way,
- **booster** - this one makes all surrounding lasers and v-beams shoot longer
  and re-charger faster; you can "stack" boosters to increase total boost – each
  laser can be boosted up to 8 times and each v-beam up to 6 times (not 8,
  because 2 tiles are reserved.

Our base have 5 cores. Each enemy is capable of destroying one core. Without
cores, we cannot survive, it's that simple.

Good luck! You are our last hope…
